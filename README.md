# Django-Blog
This project is made using Django and Vue.js. I will deploy it to heroku and share the link here.
It is still under development. The project is an extension of Blog tutorial by Sir Corey Schafer.
The features I introduced are:
1) Post Likes using Vue and Fetch
2) Comment (Page is refreshed every time, some problems need to be resolved so that it do not refresh)
3) Search Posts By Title
All the uploaded files contain cmments which make it easy to understand and refer back to some core concepts instead of watching videos again which will take a lots of time.
